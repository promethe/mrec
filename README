Mobile Recommendations
======================

Kakapo
------
    Kakapo is the Google App Engine piece of software that will provide a web
    front end and a storage facility for the Mobile recommendations.

Kiwi
----
    Kiwi is the iPhone application that will be able to access the data stored
    in kakapo, save the information in the database with the associated
    ratings, and display everything in a proper UX interface.

Naming
------
    All the names are derived from the New Zealand's endemic, flightless
    birds. Both are close to extinction. And both are really incredibly cute.
